# the Odin Project - Calculator

It's a calculator!

See it live [here](https://m-mackey.github.io/calculator/).

## Built With

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## (Some of) What I Learned

- CSS Nesting  
  Being able to nest nest the majority of my button styles all under the same main selector so much easier to read and track.  
  It's nice to have everything all in one place!
- Subgrid  
  I've used Grid often before, but this was new to me (and is new in general). It's perfect for things like this calculator, where I have a bunch of buttons I need to line up. It means I can group buttons by their type (such as numbers) versus having the buttons in the HTML in the order I need them to appear, and I don't have to specify grid lines or areas for every single button either.
- Objects  
  This was my first time using objects in an project. At first it seemed like using an object to store the information for
  the calculations might be a bit too much, but it actually ended up making writing the rest of the code around it much easier.
